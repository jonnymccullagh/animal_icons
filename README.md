# Animal_Icons
Some vector images of cartoon style animals created in Inkscape.
Freely licensed so you can use them in your own projects. If you make changes or improve them you are obliged by the license to share those changes under the same license.
To amend the images open the .svg file in Inkscape. Each animal is grouped so select the animal and choose Ungroup. Then make your changes.
